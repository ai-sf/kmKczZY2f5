intro: "The scientific programme plans to show the participants a wide spectrum of high profile scientific and academic facilities present in Pisa and Florence
<br>
The European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy (LENS).
<br>
The VIRGO site of the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO).
<br>
The National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN).
<br>
