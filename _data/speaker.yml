  title: "Terahertz quantum cascade lasers: what way forward?"
  bio: "Alessandro Tredicucci is full professor of condensed matter physics at the Physics Department of Pisa University since 2014. He holds a Ph.D. in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore (1997), and was previously at Bell Labs, SNS, and CNR. <br>
  He is well known for having pioneered the field of THz quantum cascade lasers and intersubband polaritons. His activity is now also focused on graphene photonics and THz optomechanics. He has co-authored more than 230 articles (h-index is 56), holds 16 international patents, and has given more than 100 conference invited talks.<br>
  He's the recipient of several awards, among which the Occhialini Medal of the Institute of Physics / Società Italiana di Fisica and the Nick Holonyak Jr award of the Optical Society of America, of which he's also Fellow. He is presently Associate Editor of Applied Physics Letters."

  title: "Steering quantum matter with light: an introduction to laser cooling and ultracold quantum physics"
  bio: " Leonardo Fallani is Professor of Physics at University of Florence (Italy) and Research Associate of LENS European Laboratory 
  for Nonlinear Spectroscopy. His research experience is in the field of experimental atomic and optical physics, in particular on the 
  topics: laser cooling, high-precision spectroscopy, ultracold quantum gases, disordered atomic systems, many-body atomic physics.
  At University of Florence he is leading a research group studying new approaches for quantum simulation with ultracold two-electron
  fermions, merging many-body physics and metrological techniques of quantum control. He has been author of >60 publications on 
  international journals and books, and invited speaker at >60 international conferences. In 2015 he was awarded with 
  an ERC Consolidator Grant for the investigation of topological states of matter with synthetic ultracold systems."
