info: " <p> The Lights of Tuscany programme is coming to its third edition. Following last years' great success, the Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF) will be organising it once more, also including some new features and further improvements. </p>
<p>
The event will have a focus on Photonics, but a number of other topics will be touched upon, including Matter physics, Quantum Optics, Biophysics. Students will be expected to have a basic understanding of these subjects in order to effectively make the most of the programme. </p>
<p>
Moreover this edition for the first time we added a career workshop. During this session graduate students will share their working career outside of the Academia and participants will be able to meet and ask every doubt and curiosity they have to representatives of local companies with international features, in order to shape or widen the opportunities that the working environment offers to a physicist. </p>
<p> The Programme will be constantly updated as further details are provided.
